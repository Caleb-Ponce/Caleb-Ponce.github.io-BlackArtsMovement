                <p>This poem talks about How he feels trapped inside his own body, and how he feels that he doesn't even know his own life. Braka compares his body to a cage made of hot metal that if he touched it would make him scream in pain.</p>

                </a>
                <p>This poem talks about how you should live your life in a way that will leave an impact even if you feel that you have to stand alone in your endeavors. The last Stanza can be interpreted as “die soon” if your life's work ends before you do.</p>

                <p>This poem is from the perspective of a person who has just witnessed a murder. It has a fast and frantic energy in the beginning with three word sentences that just repeat the same information. As the poem goes on the speaker is able to speak more clearly and get full thoughts out as if they are calming down and we the audience get more information about this murder.</p>

                <p>This poem shows the point of view of a black musician during this time period. It describes a state of moving to the next thing but knowing that it’s just more of the same ahead, and yet pressing on anyways.</p>

                <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=29578">The Liar</a>
                <p>This Poem is written from the Perspective of Amiri and his feelings of self doubt brought on by his changing views on the world. Amiri was famously criticized for his opinions that would sometimes drastically change. So much so that at one point he felt he had changed so much that he changed his name. We can see that referenced in the end of this poem in the line “LeRoi is dead, I wonder who they mean.” as LeRoi was his original name.

                <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/29929/like-rousseau">Like Rousseau</a>
                <p>Jean-Jacques Rousseau is famous for reconceiving the social contract as a compact between the individual and a collective “general will” aimed at the common good and reflected in the laws of an ideal state and for maintaining that existing society rests on a false social contract that perpetuates inequality and rule by the rich.
                    This poem talks about Barak’s feelings on that “Social Contract” stopping people from saying what they truly want until they have held it in too long and the society needs to be torn down and built again if it is to be fair.

                <p>This Poem depicts a man who has fallen into a routine of his life and has also potentially begun to grow tired of it as we can see with the line “nobody sings anymore” as well as the extremely dark title of the poem. However in the end there may be a ray of hope the man finds in finding his daughter praying while alone in her room. During the 1960’s Amiri Baraka, at that point Leroi Jones, converted to Islam and changed his name to reflect his new life. </p>

                <p>This poem talks about black Americans after they successfully move into a city only to find similar extremely poor living conditions. There is a second part that talks about how people who could rise up to become “Heroes” often never do so out of fear of the positive and negative publicity it will bring them.</p>

                <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=29579">Snake Eyes</a>
                <p>This poem talks about the struggles of people who can barely scrape by on what they have and their struggles to keep going even when they are so low that breathing becomes a burden. It also talks about the gambits that they take to improve their status in life even though it may seem crazy to others.</p>

                </a>
                <p>This is one of Amiris longer poems and also one of the most confusing with many metaphors and a lot of burp and fart references. He switches extremely quickly between talking hockey to dictators and then Roman Emperors. It talks about the chaos of life and the hypocrisy of people who will fight for ways of life while recoiling in disgust at the actions they fought for. All ending with the line, yesterday we explained language. Saying that these people should understand what they believe in but oftentimes they don’t.</p>

                <p>This Poem is about the impatiens Amiri feels towards his fight for civil rights, the poem asks why they wait for the promise of tomorrow when they know deep down that it will be the same until they decide that the “tomorrow” they are after will be today.</p>
