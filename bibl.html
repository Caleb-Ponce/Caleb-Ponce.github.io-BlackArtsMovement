                <p>This poem talks about How he feels trapped inside his own body, and how he feels that he doesn't even know his own life. Braka compares his body to a cage made of hot metal that if he touched it would make him scream in pain.</p>

                <p>This poem talks about how you should live your life in a way that will leave an impact even if you feel that you have to stand alone in your endeavors. The last Stanza can be interpreted as “die soon” if your life's work ends before you do.</p>
