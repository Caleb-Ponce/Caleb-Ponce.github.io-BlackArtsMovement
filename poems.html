        <p id="title">An Agony. As Now.</p>
        <p>I am inside someone <br>
            who hates me. I look<br>
            out from his eyes. Smell<br>
            what fouled tunes come in<br>
            to his breath. Love his<br>
            wretched women.<br>
            <br>
            Slits in the metal, for sun. Where<br>
            my eyes sit turning, at the cool air<br>
            the glance of light, or hard flesh<br>
            rubbed against me, a woman, a man,<br>
            without shadow, or voice, or meaning.<br>
            <br>
            This is the enclosure (flesh,<br>
            where innocence is a weapon. An<br>
            abstraction. Touch. (Not mine.<br>
            Or yours, if you are the soul I had<br>
            and abandoned when I was blind and had<br>
            my enemies carry me as a dead man<br>
            (if he is beautiful, or pitied.<br>
            <br>
            It can be pain. (As now, as all his<br>
            flesh hurts me.) It can be that. Or<br>
            pain. As when she ran from me into<br>
            that forest.<br>
                            Or pain, the mind<br>
            silver spiraled whirled against the<br>
            sun, higher than even old men thought<br>
            God would be. Or pain. And the other. The<br>
            yes. (Inside his books, his fingers. They<br>
            are withered yellow flowers and were never<br>
            beautiful.) The yes. You will, lost soul, say<br>
            'beauty.' Beauty, practiced, as the tree. The<br>
            slow river. A white sun in its wet sentences.<br>
            <br>
            Or, the cold men in their gale. Ecstasy. Flesh<br>
            or soul. The yes. (Their robes blown. Their bowls<br>
            empty. They chant at my heels, not at yours.) Flesh<br>
            or soul, as corrupt. Where the answer moves too quickly.<br>
            Where the God is a self, after all.)<br>
            <br>
            Cold air blown through narrow blind eyes. Flesh,<br>
            white hot metal. Glows as the day with its sun.<br>
            It is a human love, I live inside. A bony skeleton<br>
            you recognize as words or simple feeling.<br>
            <br>
            But it has no feeling. As the metal, is hot, it is not,<br>
            given to love.<br>
            <br>
            It burns the thing<br>
            inside it. And that thing<br>
            screams.</p>

            The gaunt thing <br>

            of Europe, she will<br>

            to a pitiful imitation faggot<br>
            full of American holes and a monkey on his back <br>  
            slapped airplanes<br>
            from the empire state building<br>

            May this bitch and her sisters, all of them,<br>   
            receive my words<br>
            in all their orifices like lye mixed with<br>
            cocola and alaga syrup<br>
            <br>
            feel this shit, bitches, feel it, now laugh your<br>   
            hysterectic laughs<br>
            while your flesh burns<br>
            and your eyes peel to red mud <br>

        <p>He came back and shot. He shot him. When he came   <br>
            back, he shot, and he fell, stumbling, past the   <br>
            shadow wood, down, shot, dying, dead, to full halt.<br>
            <br>
            At the bottom, bleeding, shot dead. He died then, there  <br> 
            after the fall, the speeding bullet, tore his face   <br>
            and blood sprayed fine over the killer and the grey light.<br>
            <br>
            Pictures of the dead man, are everywhere. And his spirit  <br> 
            sucks up the light. But he died in darkness darker than   <br>
            his soul and everything tumbled blindly with him dying<br>
            <br>
            down the stairs.   <br>
            <br>
            We have no word<br>
            <br>
            on the killer, except he came back, from somewhere   <br>
            to do what he did. And shot only once into his victim's<br>
            stare, and left him quickly when the blood ran out. We know<br>
            <br>
            the killer was skillful, quick, and silent, and that the victim   <br>
            probably knew him. Other than that, aside from the caked sourness   <br>
            of the dead man's expression, and the cool surprise in the fixture<br>
            <br>
            of his hands and fingers, we know nothing. <br>

        <p>
            In the south, sleeping against          <br>
            the drugstore, growling under    <br>
            the trucks and stoves, stumbling    <br>
            through and over the cluttered eyes    <br>
            of early mysterious night. Frowning    <br>
            drunk waving moving a hand or lash.    <br>
            Dancing kneeling reaching out, letting  <br>  
            a hand rest in shadows. Squatting    <br>
            to drink or pee. Stretching to climb    <br>
            pulling themselves onto horses near    <br>
            where there was sea (the old songs    <br>
            lead you to believe). Riding out    <br>
            from this town, to another, where    <br>
            it is also black. Down a road <br>
            where people are asleep. Towards    <br>
            the moon or the shadows of houses.    <br>
            Towards the songs’ pretended sea. <br>

            She stands beside me, stands away,                         <br>
            the vague indifference  <br>
            of her dreams. Dreaming, to go on,     <br>
            and go on there, like animals fleeing     <br>
            the rise of the earth. But standing     <br>
            intangible, my lust a worked anger  <br>
            a sweating close covering, for the crudely salty soul.  <br>
  <br>
            Then back off, and where you go? Box of words     <br>
            and pictures. Steel balloons tied to our mouths.     <br>
            The room fills up, and the house. Street tilts.     <br>
            City slides, and buildings slide into the river.     <br>
            What is there left, to destroy? That is not close,     <br>
            or closer. Leaning away in the angle of language.     <br>
            Pumping and pumping, all our eyes criss cross  <br>
            and flash. It is the lovers pulling down empty structures  <br>.   
            They wait and touch and watch their dreams     <br>
            eat the morning.  <br>

        <p id="title">Preface to a Twenty Volume Suicide Note</p>
        <p>
            Lately, I've become accustomed to the way    <br>
            The ground opens up and envelopes me <br>
            Each time I go out to walk the dog. <br>
            Or the broad edged silly music the wind <br>
            Makes when I run for a bus... <br>
 <br>
            Things have come to that. <br>
 <br>
            And now, each night I count the stars, <br>
            And each night I get the same number. <br>
            And when they will not come to be counted, <br>
            I count the holes they leave. <br>
 <br>
            Nobody sings anymore. <br>
 <br>
            And then last night, I tiptoed up <br>
            To my daughter's room and heard her <br>
            Talking to someone, and when I opened <br>
            The door, there was no one there... <br>
            Only she on her knees, peeking into <br>
 <br>
            Her own clasped hands. <br>

            Where ever something breathes                                                                 <br>
            Heart beating the rise and fall <br>
            Of mountains, the waves upon the sky <br>
            Of seas, the terror is our ignorance, that’s <br>
            Why it is named after our home, earth <br>
            Where art is locked between <br>
            Gone and Destination <br>
            The destiny of some other where and feeling <br>
            The ape knew this, when his old lady pulled him up <br>
            Off the ground. Was he grateful, ask him he's still sitting up there <br>
            Watching the sky's adventures, leaving two holes for his own. Oh sing <br>
            Gigantic burp past the insects, swifter than the ugly Stanleys on the ground <br>
            Catching monkey meat for Hyenagators, absolute boss of what does not <br>
            Arrive in time to say anything. We hear that eating, that doo dooing, that <br>
            Burping, we had a nigro mayor used to burp like poison zapalote <br>
            Waddled into the cave of his lust. We got a Spring Jasper now, if <br>
            you don't like that <br>
            woid, what about courtesan, dreamed out his own replacement sprawled <br>
            Across the velvet cash register of belching and farting, his knick names when they <br>
            let him be played with. Some call him Puck, was love, we thought, now a rubber <br>
            Flat blackie banged across the ice, to get past our Goli, the Africannibus of memory. <br>
            Here. We have so many wedged between death and passivity. Like eyes that collide <br>
            With reality and cannot see anything but the inner abstraction of flatus, a <br>
            biography, a car, a walk to the guillotine, James the First, Giuliani the Second <br>
            When he tries to go national, senators will stab him, Ides of March or Not. Maybe <br>
            Both will die, James 1 and Caesar 2, as they did in the past, where we can read about <br>
            The justness of their assassinations <br>
            As we swig a little brew and laugh at the perseverance <br>
            Of disease at higher and higher levels of its elimination. <br>
            We could see anything we wanted to. Be anything we knew how to be. Build <br>
            anything we needed. Arrive anywhere we should have to go. But time is as stubborn <br>
            as space, and they compose us with definition, time place and condition. <br>
            The howlees the yowlees the yankees the super left streamlined post racial ideational <br>
            chauvinists creeep at the mouth of the venal cava. They are protesting fire and <br>
            Looking askance at the giblets we have learned to eat. “It's nobody's heart,” they <br>
            say, and we agree. It's the rest of some thing's insides. Along with the flowers, the <br>
            grass, the tubers, the river, pieces of the sky, earth, our seasoning, baked <br>
            throughout. What do you call that the anarchist of comfort asks, <br>
            Food, we say, making it up as we chew. Yesterday we explained language.  <br>

            dead from heat exhaustion <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                                               at the beach <br>
                                                               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                                               or hiding for years from cameras <br>
            only to die cheaply in the pages <br>
            of our daily lie. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                         One hero <br>
            has pretensions toward literature <br>
            one toward the cultivation of errors, arrogance, <br>
            and constantly changing disguises, as trucker, boxer, <br>
            valet, barkeep, in the aging taverns of memory. Making love <br>
            to those speedy heroines of masturbation or kicking literal evil <br>
            continually down filmy public stairs. <br>
             <br>
             <br>
            A compromise <br>
            would be silence. To shut up, even such risk <br>
            as the proper placement <br>
            of verbs and nouns. To freeze the spit <br>
            in mid-air, as it aims itself <br>
            at some valiant intellectual's face. <br>
             <br>
            There would be someone <br>
            who would understand, for whatever <br>
            fancy reason. Dead, lying, Roi, as your children <br>
            cane up, would also rise. As George Armstrong Custer <br>
            these 100 years, has never made <br>
            a mistake."</p>
