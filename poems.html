        <p id="title">An Agony. As Now.</p>
        <p>I am inside someone <br>
            who hates me. I look<br>
            out from his eyes. Smell<br>
            what fouled tunes come in<br>
            to his breath. Love his<br>
            wretched women.<br>
            <br>
            Slits in the metal, for sun. Where<br>
            my eyes sit turning, at the cool air<br>
            the glance of light, or hard flesh<br>
            rubbed against me, a woman, a man,<br>
            without shadow, or voice, or meaning.<br>
            <br>
            This is the enclosure (flesh,<br>
            where innocence is a weapon. An<br>
            abstraction. Touch. (Not mine.<br>
            Or yours, if you are the soul I had<br>
            and abandoned when I was blind and had<br>
            my enemies carry me as a dead man<br>
            (if he is beautiful, or pitied.<br>
            <br>
            It can be pain. (As now, as all his<br>
            flesh hurts me.) It can be that. Or<br>
            pain. As when she ran from me into<br>
            that forest.<br>
                            Or pain, the mind<br>
            silver spiraled whirled against the<br>
            sun, higher than even old men thought<br>
            God would be. Or pain. And the other. The<br>
            yes. (Inside his books, his fingers. They<br>
            are withered yellow flowers and were never<br>
            beautiful.) The yes. You will, lost soul, say<br>
            ‘beauty.’ Beauty, practiced, as the tree. The<br>
            slow river. A white sun in its wet sentences.<br>
            <br>
            Or, the cold men in their gale. Ecstasy. Flesh<br>
            or soul. The yes. (Their robes blown. Their bowls<br>
            empty. They chant at my heels, not at yours.) Flesh<br>
            or soul, as corrupt. Where the answer moves too quickly.<br>
            Where the God is a self, after all.)<br>
            <br>
            Cold air blown through narrow blind eyes. Flesh,<br>
            white hot metal. Glows as the day with its sun.<br>
            It is a human love, I live inside. A bony skeleton<br>
            you recognize as words or simple feeling.<br>
            <br>
            But it has no feeling. As the metal, is hot, it is not,<br>
            given to love.<br>
            <br>
            It burns the thing<br>
            inside it. And that thing<br>
            screams.</p>

        <p>
            The gaunt thing <br>  
            with no organs<br>
            creeps along the streets<br>
            of Europe, she will<br>
            commute, in her feathered bat stomach-gown<br>
            with no organs<br>
            with sores on her insides<br>
            even her head<br>
            a vast puschamber   <br>
            of pus(sy) memories<br>
            with no organs<br>
            nothing to make babies<br>
            she will be the great witch of euro-american legend<br>
            who sucked the life<br>
            from some unknown nigger<br>
            whose name will be known<br>
            but whose substance will not ever  <br> 
            not even by him<br>
            who is dead in a pile of dopeskin<br>
            <br>
            This bitch killed a friend of mine named Bob Thompson  <br> 
            a black painter, a giant, once, she reduced<br>
            to a pitiful imitation faggot<br>
            full of American holes and a monkey on his back <br>  
            slapped airplanes<br>
            from the empire state building<br>
            <br>
            May this bitch and her sisters, all of them,<br>   
            receive my words<br>
            in all their orifices like lye mixed with<br>
            cocola and alaga syrup<br>
            <br>
            feel this shit, bitches, feel it, now laugh your<br>   
            hysterectic laughs<br>
            while your flesh burns<br>
            and your eyes peel to red mud <br>

        <p id="title">Incident</p>
        <p>He came back and shot. He shot him. When he came   <br>
            back, he shot, and he fell, stumbling, past the   <br>
            shadow wood, down, shot, dying, dead, to full halt.<br>
            <br>
            At the bottom, bleeding, shot dead. He died then, there  <br> 
            after the fall, the speeding bullet, tore his face   <br>
            and blood sprayed fine over the killer and the grey light.<br>
            <br>
            Pictures of the dead man, are everywhere. And his spirit  <br> 
            sucks up the light. But he died in darkness darker than   <br>
            his soul and everything tumbled blindly with him dying<br>
            <br>
            down the stairs.   <br>
            <br>
            We have no word<br>
            <br>
            on the killer, except he came back, from somewhere   <br>
            to do what he did. And shot only once into his victim's<br>
            stare, and left him quickly when the blood ran out. We know<br>
            <br>
            the killer was skillful, quick, and silent, and that the victim   <br>
            probably knew him. Other than that, aside from the caked sourness   <br>
            of the dead man's expression, and the cool surprise in the fixture<br>
            <br>
            of his hands and fingers, we know nothing. <br>
