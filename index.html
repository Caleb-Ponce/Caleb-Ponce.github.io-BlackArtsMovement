        The relationship between art, culture and the American Civil Rights movement is incredibly complex in nature. The successes and progression of the Civil Rights movement of the 50s and 60s gave way to the Black Arts Movement which lasted throughout the 60s and 70s. Although the importance of these movements cannot be fully comprehended, our project aims to comprehend and contextualize the work of someone who was at the forefront of the Black Arts Movement. Amiri Baraka is a poet, artist, writer, and many more. What our group plans to explore is how the poems of Amiri Baraka compare to the context in which the content is placed. Amiri has published countless poems but many act as a reflection of an idea that either Amiri has analyzed or experienced. Since Amiri was so willing to explore a number of different topics through his art, we thought it would be interesting to compare the art that imitates life.

        The work of Amiri Baraka has been analyzed since his founding. The earlier work of Amiri is often characterized as political, fiery, and even radical. Like all artists, Amiris work went through a number of evolutions and his work is reflective of those changes. Amiris work is of course critically acclaimed but his work also brought lots of critics, especially in his earlier work that was often characterized as radical.
    
        Amiri Baraka and his work carry great significance. Amiri essentially being one of the originators within the Black Arts Movement, wrote and commentated often on black artist work ranging from literary works to musical creations which he found were important to the development and livelihood of a culture. Amiris work is often cited as the foundation of the Black Arts movement and is in high regard for how willing he was to challenge common opinions and views.
