    <h1>Group 3: The Black Arts Movement</h1>
    <p>The relationship between art, culture, and the American Civil Rights movement is incredibly complex in nature. The successes and progression of the Civil Rights movement of the 50s and 60s gave way to the Black Arts Movement which lasted throughout the 60s and 70s. The National Archives records on African American Heritage contains a collection on the Black Arts Movement which it defines as, “a Black nationalism movement that focused on music, literature, drama, and the visual arts made up of Black artists and intellectuals. This was the cultural section of the Black Power movement, in that its participants shared many of the ideologies of Black self-determination, political beliefs, and African American culture” (National Archives).  This collection contains a multitude of photographs and visual information on the Black Arts Movement—highlighting a lesser known after effect of the Civil Rights Movement.  Additionally, the collection contains bibliographic information on notable figures of the movement such as Maya Angelou and Nikki Giovanni.

    <h3><b>Place in literature</b></h3>
    One notable representation of the Black Arts Movement in literature is its reference by Angela Jackson, who discusses its impact in her own personal anecdote.  She describes the movement as a result of the successes achieved during the Civil Rights movement. “The mood was high in young Black America. Like Lorraine Hansberry, we called ourselves young, gifted, and black” (Jackson pg. 13). Jackson details the Black Arts Movement as one of success and cultural exploration.  The nature of the Black Arts Movement makes it difficult to place in literature, as a large portion of the movement consisted of the creation of Literature. Most sources are in agreement on the significant figures of the movement, as well as the relative dates and timespan. But the cultural impact and effects on society are a more subjective discussion open to exploration.

    <h3><b>Significance</b> </h3>
    The significance of the Black Arts Movement is a subject up for discussion. The relationship between notable examples from the collection and the time period of the project is something our group hopes to explore. Additionally, we aim to shed light on a lesser-known facet of the Civil Rights movement. Our data is comprised of mostly visual material coupled with a discussion on the significance of said material.
