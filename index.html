        The relationship between art, culture and the American Civil Rights movement is incredibly complex. The successes and progression of the Civil Rights movement of the 50s and 60s gave way to the Black Arts Movement of the 60s and 70s. This project aims to contextualize and interpret the life and poetry of Amiri Baraka, a prominent author and activist associated with the Black Arts Movement. Baraka played a founding role in the Black Arts movement and the creation of Uplift Tradition. He was an active part of the Civil Rights movement and a significant political figure during its time period.  This project explores how two of Baraka's poems, one from his early and then later career, compare to the context in which the content is placed.  Baraka has published countless poems but many acts as a reflection of an idea that either Baraka has analyzed or experienced. Baraka's work not only serves to highlight the pain and anger experienced by black Americans during the civil rights movement, but also functions as a window into Baraka's own experiences and political perspectives during this time period. 
        Despite the significance of Baraka's work, his place in the Civil Rights movement has often been overshadowed by figures with less extreme views. Baraka's more extreme views, often diving into Marxism and problematic perspectives on race and gender, have often led to his removal from early historiography of the movement. A large majority of academic analyses on Baraka's work date back to the 80's when cultural perspectives on his radical narratives become more tolerable. Additionally, he is thrust back into the spotlight of academic literature shortly after the publishing of his controversial poem “Somebody Blew Up America”, which was criticized for its antisemitic remarks. The earlier work of Amiri is often characterized as political, fiery, and even radical in its extremist viewpoints regarding race. Like all artists, Baraka's work went through a number of evolutions and his work is reflective of those changes. Baraka's work is of course critically acclaimed but also brought lots of critics, due to his radical views. In many ways Baraka's biggest strengths also served to be detrimental to his work. 
        Amiri Baraka and his work carry still great significance; as his unfiltered commentary played an important role in the movement. Baraka essentially being one of the originators within the Black Arts Movement, wrote and commentated often on black artists' work ranging from literary works to musical creations; which he found were important to the development and livelihood of a black culture. Baraka's work is often cited as the foundation of the Black Arts movement and is in high regard for how willing he was to challenge common opinions and views despite its controversies.
